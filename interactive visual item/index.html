    <p>hello! this is your typical rhythm game, but if you've never played one before here's how it works.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>press the A, S, L, or ; keys to hit the notes as they fall.</li>
    <li>each column will have a respective key assigned to it, hit the notes as they cross the line.</li>
    <li>if you miss, the screen will flash red and your combo score will reset.</li>
    <li>hit over 75% of notes to win!</li>
    <li> make sure your volume is up!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>press enter to start</p>
